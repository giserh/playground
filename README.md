The [Transitland Playground](https://transit.land/playground) is a Backbone.js app designed to be a friendly interface for the [Datastore API](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-datastore), providing a way to view and download transit data without writing any lines of code.

The Playground allowed for querying for routes, stops and operators by name:

By place:

Or map view:

Query data was provided in a table below the map:

The Playground is no longer available on [Transitland](https://transit.land), but to run it locally, use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The Mapzen [Mobility Explorer](https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer) now provides a way to view Transitland data, as well test out Mapzen mobility APIs.

# transitland-developer-playground

The [Transitland Playground](https://transit.land/playground) is a Backbone.js app designed to be a friendly interface for the [Datastore API](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-datastore), providing a way to view and download transit data without writing any lines of code. 

![Transitland Playground UI](https://github.com/transitland/playground/raw/decommission%23139/images/README_00_Transitland_Playground.png "Transitland Playground UI")

The Playground allowed for querying for routes, stops and operators by name:

![Query for routes by operator name](https://github.com/transitland/playground/raw/decommission%23139/images/README_01_routes_by_operator.png "Query for routes by operator name")

By place:

![Query for operators by place](https://github.com/transitland/playground/raw/decommission%23139/images/README_02_operators_by_place.png "Query for operators by place")

Or map view:

![Query for stops by map view](https://github.com/transitland/playground/raw/decommission%23139/images/README_03_stops_by_mapview.png "Query for stops by map view")

Query data was provided in a table below the map:

The Playground is no longer available on [Transitland](https://transit.land), but to run it locally, use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The Mapzen [Mobility Explorer](https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer) now provides a way to view Transitland data, as well test out Mapzen mobility APIs.
